# Crimson
This is just the structure to build Crimson Android.

Everything you do happens at you own risk. Entirely. You might break your phone, your alarm WON'T work for sure and to be honest - if you don't know what you're doing you WILL actually break your phone.

Speaking of it: Currently only the Nexus 5 aka hammerhead is supported. If you'd like to add support for anything else - including your microwave, fridge, iron, electric guitar or whatever - you may message me!
